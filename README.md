This project retrieves the Twitter usernames of the first 200 friends off a specified Twitter user's account. The project uses the 'twitteroauth' library in PHP to perform the Twitter API queries. The library can be found at https://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth. Note: Twitter only allows 15 queries in a 15 minute time frame to prevent abuse. If the results come up blank, it's because the rate limit has been exceeded.
